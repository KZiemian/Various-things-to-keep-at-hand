Problems with Gonum offical page

Hello,

In the talk "Talks -> An Introduction to Gonum" (https://go-talks.appspot.com/github.com/gonum/talks/2017/gonumtour.slide#1) at the page

Best regards,
Kamil Ziemian


I not a Go expert, so I don't know if this `select' will work properly. After sending first int to `ch' two lines of code with compete for receiving from this channel:
`fmt.Println(<-ch)'
`case <- ch:'
Code will work as intended only if the first line always win, but can we be sure that always be so?

Can I help with Gonum official page?

Hello,

I first must say, that I'm not consider myself a programmer. I'm rather mathematical physicist who want solve more models by using numerical methods, so don't expect much from me.

I now reading Go Language Specification and in the breaks I try code from Gonum project and read Gonum official page. I think that Gonum page can be improved in small way here and there, so can I help in this almost negligible way?

I think it would be handy

Best regards,
Kamil


Well, it would be good for a priest to be recognisable as such. Especially in case of emergency. The "clergyman" suit generally does the job of regcognision as well (at least in Germany). The cassock is more a question of tradition. We shouldn't get caught in a typically Protestant view of Church history that says everything after the Apostles was a decay. No, on the contrary. The Church has grown ever since like a tree - never changing what sort of tree it is, but growing stronger and greater, despite all whether and bugs etc. that may have befallen it.
