Problems with Gonum offical page

Hello,

In the talk "Talks -> An Introduction to Gonum" (https://go-talks.appspot.com/github.com/gonum/talks/2017/gonumtour.slide#1) at the page

Best regards,
Kamil Ziemian


I not a Go expert, so I don't know if this `select' will work properly. After sending first int to `ch' two lines of code with compete for receiving from this channel:
`fmt.Println(<-ch)'
`case <- ch:'
Code will work as intended only if the first line always win, but can we be sure that always be so?

Can I help with Gonum official page?

Hello,

I first must say, that I'm not consider myself a programmer. I'm rather mathematical physicist who want solve more models by using numerical methods, so don't expect much from me.

I now reading Go Language Specification and in the breaks I try code from Gonum project and read Gonum official page. I think that Gonum page can be improved in small way here and there, so can I help in this almost negligible way?

I think it would be handy

Best regards,
Kamil


Hello,

In the turn of events that shock no one, I end reading "Casti Connubii" before you answer my question, how can I give itÂ to you? Since I first wrote about this booklet on 6 April, I must say that you give me plenty of time to read it. So, should we meet in person or should I send it via mail? Or maybe you just don't want it? Please, have some mercy and give me an answer as soon as possible. I want to close this as soon as possible.
If you want I will meet you personally, but, I guess, it will still be faster to just send you a booklet by mail, knowing how hard it is for you to find the time.
About meeting to talk about the relation of physics to faith, about which topic you write "I think this is a task of the utmost importance", I can go, I only think that would probably never happen, since I can't remember when we meet last or even correspond, when initiative didn't lie on my part. You either don't think that things are important or you think they are important, but talking with me about them is a waste of time. In the second situation, I wish that you told me that years ago. (Also, you may use the word "important" with the wrong meaning. As you used the buzzword "witness" without knowing what it implies.)

Maybe you would want to prove me wrong and organize a meeting in a finite time. For my money, this is the only situation that would make you do so, without me taking initiative.

I need to make a comment. If you call something as being of "utmost importance" and don't spend much time dealing with this topic, it is not very important to you. Words are cheap, actions are expensive. There are things that I consider as very important, but I will not pursue, because they are not the most important things to me. I think someone needs to deal with them, but they are not so important in my estimation, that I need to be such a person. I'm fine with that.
I'm not fine with you or any other person declaring something to be very important or even of utmost importance, but doing nothing about it. I have a strong aversion to such empty declarations, even if I'm too often guilty of them. I agree, I need to work more on myself.
You know, when I talk with people like you, I try to remove every imaginable point of confusion and despite that, people still have problems with understanding the simple things that I said.
If you want something from me, like meet me in person, write to me, I will see what I can do. For now, after giving you "Casti Connubii" or getting information that you don't want, I need to prove to you that my inability to leave you alone was not dictated by mental illness or other nonsense, but by my attempts to obey the Lord. And, in a strange way, this means leave you alone for time long enough to prove that. Yes, I repeat myself, but I hope it will result in a better understanding of me.
I hope that I did everything that I could to help you leave a sunny illusion and see the world in a more accurate way. I failed in this attempt and I probably some time in the future will wonder, how ideology can make people so blind as it made you. From my point of view, you ambreaced some strange ideology that prevented you from understanding the extent of Satan's power in this world and replaced it with the illusion of positive thinking.
Okay, even if I don't like it, I need to write about your children. "As I shared with you think for which I think I can be genuinely proud of my children and heard in response only some vague dark perspectives for the future I will think twice next time." Your children's attitude towards religion until they are under 20 years of age, will not impress me. They are not even 10 years of age, they know so little about the world and their worldview will probably change drastically before they reach the age of 20. In this age, they probably see no problems with accepting what their parents accept and don't have many problems that living in the XXI century pose to Christians. Also, they are children under 10 years of age and they have very limited ways to practice faith, because they are children and you need the right that you acquire as an adult to be able to fully practice the faith. At least this is the case in 99.9999% of cases. (This is a deep topic, but I hope that you won't be hairsplitting it too much.) I think sociological research shows that today in Poland mostly people between 10 and 19 years are abandoning the faith. If so, this is not a surprise for me.

This is why I'm totally not impressed by what your children do now. When they will be 20 years old, yes, I may be impressed. But, you should know, that when it comes to religion, making me impressed is something that happens very rarely. I just have decent standards for being good Christians and very few people achieve them, myself included.
To repeat myself. I hope that I did everything that I could, to make you go beyond the veil of your ideology. I failed. Maybe you will encounter someone wiser than me, that will convince you that you live under a veil that covers for you the real world. But, after seeing your ability to explain to yourself harsh reality, I wonder, what needs to happen to change your basic outlook? Which for me is contrary to Christianity, which in its ortodox form, teaches that we need to see reality as it is at a given time? Maybe your private world needs to start crumbling to make you reconsider your basic assumptions.? Like your parish church being closed (it is so hideous, that I will be glad at some level, if they destroy this architectural sin), new priest will start saying things so contrary to the Church teaching, like fornication is good and desired by God and divorce is an act of mercy, or you son deciding to embrace gay life and sex with other man?

I don't wish anybody to embrace sodomite life style, but I cannot exclude that one of your sons will make this terrible choice. There only small probability that mass promotion of it will be crushed in the next five years and history know example of solid father having very deviant children. Like Alan Keyes and his daughter Maya Marcel-Keyes. This is complicated topic, but this mail is already to long.

To protect my good name, I must say that I go on holiday 1 July and come back around 9 July. During this time I may not be able to reply to you.

I attached example of blasphemy that I encounter today. It is everywhere.
