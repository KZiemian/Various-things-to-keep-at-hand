[Verse 1]
This morning I made the call
The one that ends it all
Hanging up, I wanted to cry
But dammit, this well's gone dry

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Not for the money
Not for the fame
Not for the power
Just no more games

[Chorus]
But now I'm safe in the eye of a tornado
I can't replace the lies that let a thousand days go
No more living trapped inside, in her way I'll surely die
In the eye of the tornado, blow me away

[Verse 2]
You'll grow to loathe my name
You'll hate me just the same
You won't need your breath
And soon you'll meet your death

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Not from the years
Not from the use
Not from the tears
Just self-abuse
