I found person of 久山 宏 expert on polish and russian literature.

I just



いいえ They teach that this is "no" in Japanese, but I also here that this word is not used by normal people, that it is "textbook Japanese" not the real one. What is your opinion on that matter?

あい I hope that I will never again forgot this world.

あか From when I remember, this is my favorite color.

か Word "mosqituo" is not the most important one to know, but at least it is easy to remember.

かく This is why I try to learn Japanese words.

きく I think I quite good at that.

I checked it and at this moment I listen to and make a comments to first 300 episodes. Assuming that one episode is 10 minute long it is 50 hours of listening to Japanese. Now I need to expand my vocabulary.

Mikołaj Melanowicz is polish Japanese studies profesor. In the 1990s he wrote three volume work about Japanese literature from the VI century to the XX century. I guess than in this books can be more about Japanese literature that some people learn in Japanese schools.

In second volume of 銀の匙 we have heartwarming story of making pizza, main hero 八軒 勇吾 works on a farm during the summer, which give him few surprises. We also witness hars and joyful rivalry of agricultural and technical schoold. This manga can be so fun to read.



Today I finally watched lecture by Gary Leupp "Bad Monks, Temple Warriors: The Spectrum of Japanese Religious History", while training my hiragana writing skills. Lecture is very interesting, you can find link below.

TO POST

In first volume of manga 銀の匙 we learn that main character 八軒 勇吾 has unhealthy obsesion with having the best grades. When he has the highest average in the school he feel bad because in every test someone else had higher score than him. You can feel sorry for him, but it is show in such hilarious manner, that it can bring smail to your face.



Four volume of 銀の匙 is hard to describe, since outside hilarious story about escaping school to see "it", there is no self contained arc in it. At least that is looking to me now. I want to know what will happene in volume five.
